# Arduino Uno Motion Sensor & WebSockets

This was a little project I created as an excuse to play around with Arduino as well as websockets.

I wanted to take in input from the physical world, and have visual output in the web browser.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this locally, you will need:

>node installed
>johnny-five installed
>socket.io installed
>Arduino Uno, plus the motion sensor driver plugged in to the pin 7 (http://johnny-five.io/examples/motion/)
